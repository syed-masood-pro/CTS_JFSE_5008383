1) Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems.

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself within its own definition. It's a powerful tool for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems. In this code, calculateFutureValue calculates the future value for one fewer period (periods - 1) and then uses that result to calculate the future value for the current period.


2) Discuss the time complexity of your recursive algorithm.

The original recursive implementation in this code has a time complexity of O(n^periods). This happens because for each period, a new recursive call is made, potentially calculating the same subproblems multiple times.


3) Explain how to optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation.

For scenarios involving large time periods or complex calculations, recursion can lead to a stack overflow or inefficient computation. To optimize:

    Memoization: Store previously computed results to avoid redundant calculations.

    Iterative Approach: Replace recursion with an iterative approach to save on stack space and reduce overhead.
